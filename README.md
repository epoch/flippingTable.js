# flipping table

An interactable animated flipping table emoji using just characters. Seems like a good idea at the time. It was mainly used as an example starting point to show how you could refactor something that is starting to become painful to maintain.

## features

- hover on emoji to flip table
- press space to do table lifts
- gets tired after doing a 5
- you can add a message to be placed on table with using a query string `?message=`

for example
